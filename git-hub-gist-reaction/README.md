# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the needed project modules since they are not pushed on git.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Versions of the app

V1 - Multiple pages with less components (not a good idea)

V2 - Restructured project with a Search page and a page to show data

## Further improvements

Better UI/UX (more responsive to minimization and phone usage)
Adding more functionality such as:
 1. Search bar overlay that can be glised upwards to show the search.
 2. Better user experience by including the search page and the page for showing data in one single page that just adds more components.
 3. Instead of reddirecting the users to show data about a gist it will be shown as a new component at the bottom of the gist box
 4. Reddirects to user profile and also fork profiles

## Note

The data folder is just for testing purposes in the development phase to not overrun the API with requests.
