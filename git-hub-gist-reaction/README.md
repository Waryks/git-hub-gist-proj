# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Versions of the app

V1 - Multiple pages with less components (not a good idea)

V2 - Restructured project with a Search page and a page to show data

## Further improvements

Better UI/UX (more responsive to minimization and phone usage)
Adding more functionality such as:
 1. Search bar overlay that can be glised upwards to show the search.
 2. Better user experience by including the search page and the page for showing data in one single page that just adds more components.
 3. Instead of reddirecting the users to show data about a gist it will be shown as a new component at the bottom of the gist box
 4. Reddirects to user profile and also fork profiles
